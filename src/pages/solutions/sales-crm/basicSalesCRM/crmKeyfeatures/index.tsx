            Why shouldn't I use spreadsheets to manage my customer relationships?

            Here is why spreadsheets manage customer relationships. With the limited functionality and scalability of spreadsheets, they can quickly become overwhelming as your business grows. Untimely errors and data inconsistencies can lead to lost opportunities and frustrated teams. Plus, the lack of real-time collaboration makes it difficult to stay aligned. Spreadsheets are fine for small-scale operations, but as your data needs evolve, they become a bottleneck. Dedicated CRM software offers greater functionality, security, and scalability, eliminating data entry challenges and providing a better choice for business growth.
